about=PhyloGeoRec is a tool that very useful to visualizing geophylogenies (phylogeography reconstruction) in QGIS. 
	This plugin is a fork of Qgis2threejs plugin (Version 1.4) which specially designed for making and visualizing geophylogenies, 
	and by utilising Qgis2threejs engine abilities, this plugin able to export terrain data, map canvas image and vector data to your web browser and combined it with your geophylogenies. 
	So, you can visualized interactive geophylogenies and view exported 3D objects on web browser which supports WebGL. 
	
	This plugin uses three.js library and Bio.Phylo library from Biopython Package.

changelog=
	Version 1.00.b7.5 (Build 12)
	- First release of PhyloGeoRec.
    - Included with Qgis2threejs engine version 1.4. 
	- Enable geophylogeny creation based from Newick format-based files (Currently support Newick Files (*.nwk) and GenGIS 2 (Parks et al., 2013 ) GTM Model (*.gtm)).
	- Enable geophylogeny creation in KML Format (Currently).
	- Currently not support ESRI shapefile creation for geophylogeny creation, but support reading geophylogeny (in ESRI Shapefile format) created by Geophylobuilder (Kidd & Liu, 2008).
